        <h2 id="headline">Here are 8 <em>interesting</em> facts about Bottlenose Dolphins:</h2>
        <li>Bottlenose Dolphins, named after their beaklike snouts, are typically found in warm seas, and sometimes in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans.</li>
        <li>They grow about 2-4 meters long, weigh about 200-300 kg and live for an average of 20-30 years.</li>
        <li>They can swim at a constant speed upwards of 15 miles per hour and need to voluntarily surface to breath.</li>
        <li>Unlike most other mammals, a bottlenose dolphin has a unique sleeping pattern. It sleeps one half of its brain at a time, sometimes leaving one eye shut too.</li>
        <li>Although not their primary mode of navigation, bottlenose dolphins have sharp eyesights both in air and underwater.</li>
        <li>They use sounds such as clicking and squeaking to communicate. They identify each other using signature whistle sounds.             </li>
        <li>The high intelligence of a bottlenose dolphin makes it a powerful predator even as a lone dolphin.</li>
        <li>A research conducted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago" target="_blank"> University of Chicago<a/> showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember the whistles of dolphins they lived with after <strong>20 years</strong> of separation. This shows that dolphins have the longest memory in any species asides humans.</li>
